  ABSTRACT = {The essence of blockchain smart contracts lies in the execution of business logic code in a decentralized architecture in which the execution outcomes are trusted and agreed upon by all the executing nodes. Despite the decentralized and trustless architectures of the blockchain systems, smart contracts on their own cannot access data from the external world. Instead, smart contracts interact with off-chain external data sources, called oracles, whose primary job is to collect and provide data feeds and input to smart contracts. However, there is always risk of oracles providing corrupt, malicious, or inaccurate data. In this paper, we analyze and present the notion of trust in the oracles used in blockchain ecosystems. We analyze and compare trust-enabling features of the leading blockchain oracle approaches, techniques, and platforms. Moreover, we discuss open research challenges that should be addressed to ensure secure and trustworthy blockchain oracles.},

  ABSTRACT = {Many blockchain transactions require blockchain-external data sources to provide data. Oracle systems have been proposed as a link between blockchains and blockchain-external resources. However, these Oracle systems vary greatly in assumptions and applicability and each system addresses the challenge of data on-chaining partly. We argue that Data On-chaining must be done in a trustworthy manner and, as a first contribution, define a set of key requirements for Trustworthy Data On-chaining. Further, we provide an in-depth assessment and comparison of state-of-the-art Oracle systems with regards to these requirements. This differentiation pinpoints the need for a uniform understanding of and directions for future research on Trustworthy Data On-chaining.},
